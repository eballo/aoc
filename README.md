# Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual coding event that takes place every December. It consists of 25 daily programming puzzles of increasing difficulty, designed to challenge and entertain participants of all skill levels.

## Getting Started
To get started with Advent of Code, simply visit the [Advent of Code website](https://adventofcode.com/) and sign in with your account or create a new one if you haven't already. Once logged in, you'll be able to access the current year's puzzles as well as previous years' puzzles.

## What can you find in here ?
Here you can the python solutions for each year and day that I have done for AOC.

**NOTE:** the input data is not in the repository, you will need to use your own if you want to test it.

## Quick start template
We can run the command:
```shell
 make create_template_and_input_data
```
Will ask you few questions and after that will create a directory for the year and the day and download the input data to work with.
